- You have full control to create, edit, and delete your data at any time.

## Data Security
- All user input is validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, injection).
- Sensitive operations (file access, storage) are protected and never expose data externally.

## User Rights
- You may delete all your data at any time via the extension interface.
- Uninstalling the extension will remove all locally stored data.
